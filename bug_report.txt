Description of the bug:
PGD adversarial training fails irrespective of the choices of hyperparameters that I have tried
even though just the PGD attack works very well.

Steps to reliably reproduce the bug:
Run scripts/adv_train.py with any combination of hyperparams.
The hyperparam settings are defined at the top of the file as config.

Relevant sections of the code:
In feedforward_robust.py, the code for adversarial training is contained in pgd_fit()

Possible Hypotheses for bug:
Too sensitive to hyperparams and have not been able to find the right combination to make it work.
Some issue in the adversarial training code

Things I have tried already:
Performed hyperparam grid search. But none of them train nicely.
Inspected the tensorflow graph on tensorboard, which looks as expected.
